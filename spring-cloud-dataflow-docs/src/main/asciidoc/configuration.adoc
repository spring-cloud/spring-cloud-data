This section covers how to configure Spring Cloud Data Flow Server's features, such as which relational database to use and security.
It also covers how to configure Spring Cloud Data Flow's shell features.
--

[[enable-disable-specific-features]]
== Feature Toggles

Sprig Cloud Data Flow Server offers specific set of features that can be enabled/disabled when launching. These features include all the lifecycle operations and REST endpoints (server and client implementations, including the shell and the UI) for:

* Streams (requires Skipper)
* Tasks
* Analytics
* Task Scheduler

One can enable and disable these features by setting the following boolean properties when launching the Data Flow server:

* `spring.cloud.dataflow.features.streams-enabled`
* `spring.cloud.dataflow.features.tasks-enabled`
* `spring.cloud.dataflow.features.analytics-enabled`
* `spring.cloud.dataflow.features.schedules-enabled`

By default, stream (requires Skipper), tasks, and analytics are enabled and Task Scheduler is disabled by default.

NOTE: Since the analytics feature is enabled by default, the Data Flow Server expects to have a valid Redis store available to server as the analytic repository, because Spring Cloud Data Flow provides a default implementation of analytics based on Redis.
This also means that the Data Flow Server's `health` depends on the redis store availability as well.
If you do not want Data Flow's endpoints to read analytics data written to Redis, then disable the analytics feature by setting the property mentioned above.

The REST `/about` endpoint provides information on the features that have been enabled and disabled.

[[configuration-rdbms]]
== Database

A relational database is used to store stream and task definitions as well as the state of executed tasks.
Spring Cloud Data Flow provides schemas for H2, HSQLDB, MySQL, Oracle, Postgresql, DB2, and SqlServer. The schema is automatically created when the server starts.


By default, Spring Cloud Data Flow offers an embedded instance of the H2 database.
The H2 database is good for development purposes but is not recommended for production use.

The JDBC drivers for *MySQL* (through the MariaDB driver), *HSQLDB*, *PostgreSQL*, and embedded *H2* are available without additional configuration.
If you are using any other database, then you need to put the corresponding JDBC driver jar on the classpath of the server.

The database properties can be passed as environment variables or command-line arguments to the Data Flow Server.

The following example shows how to define a database connection with environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export spring_datasource_url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
export spring_datasource_username=myuser
export spring_datasource_password=mypass
export spring_datasource_driver_class_name="org.postgresql.Driver"
----

The following example shows how to define a MySQL database connection with command Line arguments

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local/target/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-{project-version}.jar \
    --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb \
    --spring.datasource.username=<user> \
    --spring.datasource.password=<password> \
    --spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver &
----

The following example shows how to define a PostgreSQL database connection with command line arguments:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local/target/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-{project-version}.jar \
    --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb \
    --spring.datasource.username=<user> \
    --spring.datasource.password=<password> \
    --spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver &
----

The following example shows how to define a HSQLDB database connection with command line arguments:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local/target/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-{project-version}.jar \
    --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:hsqldb://localhost:9001/mydb \
    --spring.datasource.username=SA \
    --spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver &
----

NOTE: If you wish to use an external H2 database instance instead of the one
embedded with Spring Cloud Data Flow, set the
`spring.dataflow.embedded.database.enabled` property to false.  If
`spring.dataflow.embedded.database.enabled` is set to false or a database
other than h2 is specified as the datasource, the embedded database does not
start.

=== Disabling database schema creation and migration strategies

You can control whether or not Data Flow bootstraps your database on startup. On most production environments chances are you will not have enough privileges to do so.
If that's the case you can disable it by setting the property `spring.cloud.dataflow.rdbms.initialize.enable` to `false`.
The scripts that the server uses to bootstrap the database can be found under `spring-cloud-dataflow-core/src/main/resources/` folder.

For new installations run the corresponding database script located under `/schemas` and `/migrations.1.x.x`, for upgrades from version `1.2.0` you only need to run the `/migrations.1.x.x` scripts.


=== Adding a Custom JDBC Driver
To add a custom driver for the database (for example, Oracle), you should rebuild the Data Flow Server and add the dependency to the Maven `pom.xml` file.
Since there is a Spring Cloud Data Flow Server for each target platform, you need to modify the appropriate maven `pom.xml` for each platform.  There are tags in each GitHub repository for each server version.

To add a custom JDBC driver dependency for the local server implementation:

. Select the tag that corresponds to the version of the server you want to rebuild and clone the github repository.
. Edit the spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local/pom.xml and, in the `dependencies` section, add the dependency for the database driver required.  In the following example , an Oracle driver has been chosen:

[source, xml]
----
<dependencies>
...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.oracle.jdbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>ojdbc8</artifactId>
    <version>12.2.0.1</version>
  </dependency>
...
</dependencies>
----

[start=3]
. Build the application as described in <<appendix-building.adoc#building, Building Spring Cloud Data Flow>>

You can also provide default values when rebuilding the server by adding the necessary properties to the dataflow-server.yml file,
as shown in the following example for PostgreSQL:

[source]
----
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
    username: myuser
    password: mypass
    driver-class-name:org.postgresql.Driver
----

[[configuration-deployer]]
== Local Deployer
You can use the following configuration properties of the Data Flow Local server's deployer to customize how applications are deployed:

[source,properties,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes,macros"]
----
spring.cloud.deployer.local.workingDirectoriesRoot=java.io.tmpdir # Directory in which all created processes will run and create log files.

spring.cloud.deployer.local.deleteFilesOnExit=true # Whether to delete created files and directories on JVM exit.

spring.cloud.deployer.local.envVarsToInherit=TMP,LANG,LANGUAGE,"LC_.*. # Array of regular expression patterns for environment variables that are passed to launched applications.

spring.cloud.deployer.local.javaCmd=java # Command to run java.

spring.cloud.deployer.local.shutdownTimeout=30 # Max number of seconds to wait for app shutdown.

spring.cloud.deployer.local.javaOpts= # The Java options to pass to the JVM

spring.cloud.deployer.local.freeDiskSpacePercentage=5 # The target percentage of free disk space to always aim for when cleaning downloaded resources (typically via the local maven repository). Specify as an integer greater than zero and less than 100. Default is 5.
----

[NOTE]
====
Data Flow Local server itself overrides
`spring.cloud.deployer.local.freeDiskSpacePercentage` to `0` from its
default value.
====

When deploying the application, you can also set deployer properties prefixed with `deployer.<name of application>`. For example, to set Java options for the time application in the `ticktock` stream, use the following stream deployment properties.
[source,bash]
----
dataflow:> stream create --name ticktock --definition "time --server.port=9000 | log"
dataflow:> stream deploy --name ticktock --properties "deployer.time.local.javaOpts=-Xmx2048m -Dtest=foo"
----

As a convenience, you can set the `deployer.memory` property to set the Java option `-Xmx`, as shown in the following example:

[source,bash]
----
dataflow:> stream deploy --name ticktock --properties "deployer.time.memory=2048m"
----

At deployment time, if you specify an `-Xmx` option in the `deployer.<app>.local.javaOpts` property in addition to a value of the `deployer.<app>.local.memory` option, the value in the `javaOpts` property has precedence.  Also, the `javaOpts` property set when deploying the application has precedence over the Data Flow Server's `spring.cloud.deployer.local.javaOpts` property.

[[configuration-maven]]
== Maven
If you want to override specific maven configuration properties (remote repositories, proxies, and others) or run the Data Flow Server behind a proxy,
you need to specify those properties as command line arguments when starting the Data Flow Server, as shown in the following example:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-{project-version}.jar --maven.localRepository=mylocal
--maven.remote-repositories.repo1.url=https://repo1
--maven.remote-repositories.repo1.auth.username=user1
--maven.remote-repositories.repo1.auth.password=pass1
--maven.remote-repositories.repo1.snapshot-policy.update-policy=daily
--maven.remote-repositories.repo1.snapshot-policy.checksum-policy=warn
--maven.remote-repositories.repo1.release-policy.update-policy=never
--maven.remote-repositories.repo1.release-policy.checksum-policy=fail
--maven.remote-repositories.repo2.url=https://repo2
--maven.remote-repositories.repo2.policy.update-policy=always
--maven.remote-repositories.repo2.policy.checksum-policy=fail
--maven.proxy.host=proxy1
--maven.proxy.port=9010 --maven.proxy.auth.username=proxyuser1
--maven.proxy.auth.password=proxypass1
----

By default, the protocol is set to `http`. You can omit the auth properties if the proxy does not need a username and password. Also, the maven `localRepository` is set to `${user.home}/.m2/repository/` by default.
As shown in the preceding example, the remote repositories can be specified along with their authentication (if needed). If the remote repositories are behind a proxy, then the proxy properties can be specified as shown in the preceding example.

The repository policies can be specified for each remote repository configuration as shown in the preceding example.
The key `policy` is applicable to both `snapshot` and the `release` repository policies.

You can refer to https://github.com/eclipse/aether-core/blob/4cf5f7a406b516a45d8bf15e7dfe3fb3849cb87b/aether-api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/aether/repository/RepositoryPolicy.java#L16[Repository Policies] for the list of
supported repository policies.

As these are Spring Boot `@ConfigurationProperties`, you can also specify them as environment variables, such as `MAVEN_REMOTE_REPOSITORIES_REPO1_URL`.
Another common option is to set the properties by setting the `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` environment variable.
The following example shows how the JSON is structured:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON='{ "maven": { "local-repository": null,
"remote-repositories": { "repo1": { "url": "https://repo1", "auth": { "username": "repo1user", "password": "repo1pass" } }, "repo2": { "url": "https://repo2" } },
"proxy": { "host": "proxyhost", "port": 9018, "auth": { "username": "proxyuser", "password": "proxypass" } } } }' java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-{project-version}.jar
----

[[configuration-logging]]
== Local Data Flow Server Logging configuration

Spring Cloud Data Flow `local` server is configured to use `RollingFileAppender` for logging.

----
logging:
  config: classpath:logback-scdf-local.xml
----

By default, the log file is configured to use:

```
<property name="LOG_FILE" value="${LOG_FILE:-${LOG_PATH:-${LOG_TEMP:-${java.io.tmpdir:-/tmp}}}/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local}"/>

```

with the logback configuration for the `RollingPolicy`:

----

<appender name="FILE"
			  class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
		<file>${LOG_FILE}.log</file>
		<rollingPolicy
				class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy">
			<!-- daily rolling -->
			<fileNamePattern>${LOG_FILE}.${LOG_FILE_ROLLING_FILE_NAME_PATTERN:-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}}.%i.gz</fileNamePattern>
			<maxFileSize>${LOG_FILE_MAX_SIZE:-100MB}</maxFileSize>
			<maxHistory>${LOG_FILE_MAX_HISTORY:-30}</maxHistory>
			<totalSizeCap>${LOG_FILE_TOTAL_SIZE_CAP:-500MB}</totalSizeCap>
		</rollingPolicy>
		<encoder>
			<pattern>${FILE_LOG_PATTERN}</pattern>
		</encoder>
	</appender>

----

To check the `java.io.tmpdir` for the current Spring Cloud Data Flow Server `local` server,

```
jinfo <pid> | grep "java.io.tmpdir"

```

If you want to change or override any of the properties `LOG_FILE`, `LOG_PATH`, `LOG_TEMP`, `LOG_FILE_MAX_SIZE`, `LOG_FILE_MAX_HISTORY` and `LOG_FILE_TOTAL_SIZE_CAP`, please set them as system properties.

[[configuration-skipper]]
== Skipper
Data Flow Server delegates to the Skipper server the management of the Stream's lifecycle.  Set the configuration property `spring.cloud.skipper.client.serverUri` to the location of Skipper, e.g.

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-{project-version}.jar --spring.cloud.skipper.client.serverUri=http://192.51.100.1:7577/api
----

[[configuration-security]]
== Security

By default, the Data Flow server is unsecured and runs on an unencrypted HTTP connection.
You can secure your REST endpoints as well as the Data Flow Dashboard by enabling HTTPS
and requiring clients to authenticate using https://oauth.net/2/[OAuth 2.0].

[NOTE]
====
By default, the REST endpoints (administration, management, and health) as well as the Dashboard UI do not require authenticated access.
====

While you can theoretically choose any OAuth provider in conjunction with
Spring Cloud Data Flow, we recommend using the
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa[CloudFoundry User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server].

Not only is the UAA OpenID certified and is used by Cloud Foundry but it can
also be used in local stand-alone deployment scenarios.

Furthermore, the UAA not only provides its own user store, but also provides
comprehensive LDAP integration.

[[configuration-security-enabling-https]]
=== Enabling HTTPS

By default, the dashboard, management, and health endpoints use HTTP as a transport.
You can switch to HTTPS by adding a certificate to your configuration in
`application.yml`, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8443                                         # <1>
  ssl:
    key-alias: yourKeyAlias                          # <2>
    key-store: path/to/keystore                      # <3>
    key-store-password: yourKeyStorePassword         # <4>
    key-password: yourKeyPassword                    # <5>
    trust-store: path/to/trust-store                 # <6>
    trust-store-password: yourTrustStorePassword     # <7>
----

<1> As the default port is `9393`, you may choose to change the port to a more common HTTPs-typical port.
<2> The alias (or name) under which the key is stored in the keystore.
<3> The path to the keystore file. Classpath resources may also be specified, by using the classpath prefix - for example: `classpath:path/to/keystore`.
<4> The password of the keystore.
<5> The password of the key.
<6> The path to the truststore file. Classpath resources may also be specified, by using the classpath prefix - for example: `classpath:path/to/trust-store`
<7> The password of the trust store.

NOTE: If HTTPS is enabled, it completely replaces HTTP as the protocol over
which the REST endpoints and the Data Flow Dashboard interact. Plain HTTP requests
will fail. Therefore, make sure that you configure your Shell accordingly.

[[configuration-security-self-signed-certificates]]
==== Using Self-Signed Certificates

For testing purposes or during development, it might be convenient to create self-signed certificates.
To get started, execute the following command to create a certificate:

[source,bash]
----
$ keytool -genkey -alias dataflow -keyalg RSA -keystore dataflow.keystore \
          -validity 3650 -storetype JKS \
          -dname "CN=localhost, OU=Spring, O=Pivotal, L=Kailua-Kona, ST=HI, C=US"  # <1>
          -keypass dataflow -storepass dataflow
----

<1> `CN` is the important parameter here. It should match the domain you are trying to access - for example, `localhost`.

Then add the following lines to your `application.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8443
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    key-alias: dataflow
    key-store: "/your/path/to/dataflow.keystore"
    key-store-type: jks
    key-store-password: dataflow
    key-password: dataflow
----

This is all that is needed for the Data Flow Server. Once you start the server,
you should be able to access it at `https://localhost:8443/`.
As this is a self-signed certificate, you should hit a warning in your browser, which
you need to ignore.

[[configuration-security-self-signed-certificates-shell]]
==== Self-Signed Certificates and the Shell

By default, self-signed certificates are an issue for the shell, and additional steps
are necessary to make the shell work with self-signed certificates. Two options
are available:

* Add the self-signed certificate to the JVM truststore.
* Skip certificate validation.

===== Adding the Self-signed Certificate to the JVM Truststore

In order to use the JVM truststore option, we need to
export the previously created certificate from the keystore, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ keytool -export -alias dataflow -keystore dataflow.keystore -file dataflow_cert -storepass dataflow
----

Next, we need to create a truststore which the shell can use, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ keytool -importcert -keystore dataflow.truststore -alias dataflow -storepass dataflow -file dataflow_cert -noprompt
----

Now, you are ready to launch the Data Flow Shell by using the following JVM arguments:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=dataflow \
       -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/dataflow.truststore \
       -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jks \
       -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-{project-version}.jar
----

[TIP]
====
In case you run into trouble establishing a connection over SSL, you can enable additional
logging by using and setting the `javax.net.debug` JVM argument to `ssl`.
====

Do not forget to target the Data Flow Server with the following:

[source,bash]
----
dataflow:> dataflow config server https://localhost:8443/
----

===== Skipping Certificate Validation

Alternatively, you can also bypass the certification validation by providing the
optional command-line parameter `--dataflow.skip-ssl-validation=true`.

If you set this command-line parameter, the shell accepts any (self-signed) SSL
certificate.

[WARNING]
====
If possible, you should avoid using this option. Disabling the trust manager
defeats the purpose of SSL and makes you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
====

[[configuration-security-oauth2]]
=== Authentication using OAuth 2.0

In order to support authentication and authorization, Spring Cloud Data
Flow is using https://oauth.net/2/[OAuth 2.0] and https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect].
It lets you integrate Spring Cloud Data Flow into Single Sign On (SSO)
environments.

NOTE: As of Spring Cloud Data Flow 2.0, OAuth2 is the only mechanism
for providing authentication and authorization.

The following OAuth2 Grant Types are used:

* *Authorization Code*: Used for the GUI (browser) integration. Visitors are redirected to your OAuth Service for authentication
* *Password*: Used by the shell (and the REST integration), so visitors can log in with username and password
* *Client Credentials*: Retrieve an access token directly from your OAuth provider and pass it to the Data Flow server by using the Authorization HTTP header

NOTE: Currently, Spring Cloud Data Flow uses opaque tokens and not transparent
tokens (JWT).

The REST endpoints can be accessed in two ways:

* *Basic authentication*, which uses the Password Grant Type under the covers to authenticate with your OAuth2 service
* *Access token*, which uses the Client Credentials Grant Type under the covers

NOTE: When authentication is set up, it is strongly recommended to enable HTTPS
as well, especially in production environments.

You can turn on OAuth2 authentication by adding the following to `application.yml` or by setting
environment variables:

[source,yaml]
----
security:
  oauth2:
    client:
      client-id: myclient                                             # <1>
      client-secret: mysecret
      access-token-uri: http://127.0.0.1:9999/oauth/token
      user-authorization-uri: http://127.0.0.1:9999/oauth/authorize
    resource:
      user-info-uri: http://127.0.0.1:9999/me
----

<1> Providing the Client ID in the OAuth Configuration Section activates OAuth2 security

You can verify that basic authentication is working properly by using curl, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -u myusername:mypassword http://localhost:9393/ -H 'Accept: application/json'
----

As a result, you should see a list of available REST endpoints.

IMPORTANT: Please be aware that when accessing the Root URL with a web browser and
enabled security, you are redirected to the Dashboard UI. In order to see the
list of REST endpoints, specify the `application/json`. Also be sure to add the
Accept header using tools such as Postman (Chrome) or RESTClient (Firefox).

Besides Basic Authentication, you can also provide an Access Token in order to
access the REST Api. In order to make that happen, you would retrieve an
OAuth2 Access Token from your OAuth2 provider first and then pass that Access Token to
the REST Api using the *Authorization* Http header:

```
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" http://localhost:9393/ -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

[[configuration-security-oauth2-authorization]]
==== OAuth REST Endpoint Authorization

The OAuth2 authentication option uses the same authorization rules as used by the
<<configuration-security-basic-authentication, Traditional Authentication>> option.

[TIP]
====
The authorization rules are defined in `dataflow-server-defaults.yml` (part of
the Spring Cloud Data Flow Core module). Please see the chapter on
<<customizing-authorization, customizing authorization>> for more details.
====

Because the determination of security roles is environment-specific,
Spring Cloud Data Flow, by default, assigns all roles to authenticated OAuth2
users by using the `DefaultDataflowAuthoritiesExtractor` class.

You can customize that behavior by providing your own Spring bean definition that
extends Spring Security OAuth's `AuthoritiesExtractor` interface. In that case,
the custom bean definition takes precedence over the default one provided by
Spring Cloud Data Flow.

[[configuration-security-oauth2-shell]]
==== OAuth Authentication using the Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell

When using the Shell, the credentials can either be provided via username and password
or by specifying a _credentials-provider_ command.

If your OAuth2 provider supports the _Password_ Grant Type you can start the
_Data Flow Shell_ with:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-{project-version}.jar \
  --dataflow.uri=http://localhost:9393 \
  --dataflow.username=my_username --dataflow.password=my_password
----

NOTE: Keep in mind that when authentication for Spring Cloud Data Flow is enabled,
the underlying OAuth2 provider *must* support the _Password_ OAuth2 Grant Type
if you want to use the Shell via username/password authentication.

From within the Data Flow Shell you can also provide credentials by using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
dataflow config server --uri http://localhost:9393 --username my_username --password my_password
----

Once successfully targeted, you should see the following output:

[source,bash]
----
dataflow:>dataflow config info
dataflow config info

╔═══════════╤═══════════════════════════════════════╗
║Credentials│[username='my_username, password=****']║
╠═══════════╪═══════════════════════════════════════╣
║Result     │                                       ║
║Target     │http://localhost:9393                  ║
╚═══════════╧═══════════════════════════════════════╝
----

Alternatively, you can specify the _credentials-provider_ command in order to
pass-in a bearer token directly, instead of providing a username and password.
This works from within the shell or by providing the
`--dataflow.credentials-provider-command` command-line argument when starting the Shell.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using the _credentials-provider_ command, please be aware that your
specified command *must* return a _Bearer token_ (Access Token prefixed with _Bearer_).
For instance, in Unix environments the following simplistic command can be used:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-{project-version}.jar \
  --dataflow.uri=http://localhost:9393 \
  --dataflow.credentials-provider-command="echo Bearer 123456789"
----

====

==== OAuth2 Authentication Examples

This section documents following authentication scenarios:

* <<oauth2-examples-local>>
* <<oauth2-examples-github>>

[[oauth2-examples-local]]
===== Local OAuth2 Server

For local deployment scenarios, we recommend using the https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa[CloudFoundry User
Account and Authentication (UAA) Server], which is https://openid.net/certification/[OpenID certified].

While the UAA is also used by https://www.cloudfoundry.org/[Cloud Foundry],
it is also a fully featured stand alone OAuth2 server with enterprise features such as
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/develop/docs/UAA-LDAP.md[LDAP integration].

For local testing and development, you can also use the support provided by
http://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth/[Spring Security OAuth]. It
allows you to easily create your own OAuth2 Server with the following simple annotations:

* `@EnableResourceServer`
* `@EnableAuthorizationServer`

A working example application can be found at:

https://github.com/ghillert/oauth-test-server/[https://github.com/ghillert/oauth-test-server/]

Clone the project and configure Spring Cloud
Data Flow with the respective Client ID and Client Secret. Then build and start the project.

[[oauth2-examples-github]]
===== Authentication with GitHub

If you like to use an existing OAuth2 provider, here is an example for GitHub.
First, you need to register a new application under your GitHub account at:

https://github.com/settings/developers[https://github.com/settings/developers]

When running a default version of Spring Cloud Data Flow locally, your GitHub configuration
should look like the following image:

.Register an OAuth Application for GitHub
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-security-github.png[Register an OAuth Application for GitHub , scaledwidth="100%"]

NOTE: For the authorization callback URL, enter Spring Cloud Data Flow's Login URL - for example, `http://localhost:9393/login`.

Configure Spring Cloud Data Flow with the GitHub relevant Client ID and Secret, as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
security:
  oauth2:
    client:
      client-id: your-github-client-id
      client-secret: your-github-client-secret
      access-token-uri: https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
      user-authorization-uri: https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
    resource:
      user-info-uri: https://api.github.com/user
----

IMPORTANT: GitHub does not support the OAuth2 password grant type. As a result, you cannot use the Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell in conjunction with GitHub.

=== Securing the Spring Boot Management Endpoints

When enabling security, please also make sure that the {spring-boot-docs-reference}/html/production-ready-monitoring.html[Spring Boot HTTP Management Endpoints]
are secured as well. You can enable security for the management endpoints by adding the following to `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
management:
  contextPath: /management
  security:
    enabled: true
----

IMPORTANT: If you do not explicitly enable security for the management endpoints,
you may end up having unsecured REST endpoints, despite `security.basic.enabled`
being set to `true`.

==== Setting up a CloudFoundry User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server


Checkout, Build and Run UAA:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa.git
$ cd uaa/
$ ./gradlew  run
----

In a separate window, check if the UAA server is running:

The configuration of the UAA is driven by a
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/develop/uaa/src/main/resources/uaa.yml[uaa.yml]
file. You can provide custom configuration but in this case we will use the
embedded default configuration that provides also a default user:

[source,bash]
----
curl -v -d"username=marissa&password=koala&client_id=app&grant_type=password" -u "app:appclientsecret" http://localhost:8080/uaa/oauth/token -d 'token_format=opaque'
----

This should produce output similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)
* Server auth using Basic with user 'app'

----

Using `token_format` parameter you can requested token to be either:

- opaque
- jwt

In order to configure the UAA, it is recommended to use the `uaac` command\
line tool and target the UAA server:

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install cf-uaac
$ uaac target http://localhost:8080/uaa
----

Check out user detail of user `marissa`:

[source,bash]
----
$ uaac token owner get cf marissa -s "" -p koala
$ uaac contexts
----

This should also provide the relevant token details. Next, switch to the
admin user (password is `adminsecret`):

[source,bash]
----
$ uaac token client get admin -s adminsecret
----

Get a list of all configured clients:

[source,bash]
----
$ uaac clients
----

This returns the interesting client app among others:

[source,bash]
----
…
  app
    scope: cloud_controller.read cloud_controller.write openid password.write scim.userids organizations.acme
    resource_ids: none
    authorized_grant_types: password implicit authorization_code client_credentials refresh_token
    redirect_uri: http://localhost:8080/** http://localhost:8080/app/
    autoapprove: openid
    authorities: uaa.resource
    name: The Ultimate Oauth App
    signup_redirect_url: http://localhost:8080/app/
    change_email_redirect_url: http://localhost:8080/app/
    lastmodified: 1543879731285
…
----

We are going to use that `app` for Spring Cloud Data Flow but need to update
the `redirect_uri`. We will also update the client secret:

[source,bash]
----
$ uaac client update app --redirect_uri http://localhost:9393/login
$ uaac secret set app --secret dataflow
----

Now we can update the relavant OAuth configuration in Spring Cloud Data Flow:

[source,yaml]
----
security:
  oauth2:
    client:
      client-id: app
      client-secret: dataflow
      scope: openid, dataflow.view, dataflow.create, dataflow.manage    # <1>
      access-token-uri: http://localhost:8080/uaa/oauth/token
      user-authorization-uri: http://localhost:8080/uaa/oauth/authorize
    resource:
      user-info-uri: http://localhost:8080/uaa/userinfo
----

<1> If you use scopes to identify roles, please make sure to also request
the relevant roles

[[configuration-security-role-mapping]]
===== Role Mappings

By default all roles are assigned to users that login to Spring Cloud Data Flow.
However, you can set the property:

`spring.cloud.dataflow.security.authorization.map-oauth-scopes: true`

This will instruct the the underlying `DefaultAuthoritiesExtractor` to map
OAuth scopes to the respective authorities. The following scopes are supported:

* Scope `dataflow.view` maps to the `VIEW` role
* Scope `dataflow.create` maps to the `CREATE` role
* Scope `dataflow.manage` maps to the `MANAGE` role

Additionally you can also map arbitrary scopes to each of the Data Flow roles:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    deployer:
      local:
        free-disk-space-percentage: 0
    dataflow:
      security:
        authorization:
          map-oauth-scopes: true                                    # <1>
          role-mappings:
            ROLE_VIEW: dataflow.view                                # <2>
            ROLE_CREATE: dataflow.create
            ROLE_MANAGE: dataflow.manage
----

<1> Enables explicit mapping support from OAuth scopes to Data Flow roles
<2> When role mapping support is enabled, you must provide a mapping for
all 3 Spring Cloud Data Flow roles *ROLE_MANAGE*, *ROLE_VIEW*, *ROLE_CREATE*.

[[configuration-security-ldap-authentication]]
==== LDAP Authentication

LDAP Authentication (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is indirectly
provided by Spring Cloud Data Flow using the UAA. The UAA itself provides
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/develop/docs/UAA-LDAP.md[comprehensive LDAP support].

[IMPORTANT]
====
While you may use your own OAuth2 authentication server, the LDAP support
documented here requires using the UAA as authentication server. For any
other provider, please consult the documentation for that particular provider.
====

The UAA supports authentication against an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
server using the following modes:

* https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/develop/docs/UAA-LDAP.md#ldap-search-and-bind[Direct bind]
* https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/develop/docs/UAA-LDAP.md#ldap-bind[Search and bind]
* https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/develop/docs/UAA-LDAP.md#ldap-search-and-compare[Search and Compare]

[NOTE]
====
When integrating with an external identity provider such as LDAP, authentication
within the UAA becomes *chained*. UAA first attempts to authenticate with
a user's credentials against the UAA user store before the external provider,
LDAP. For more information, see
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/develop/docs/UAA-LDAP.md#chained-authentication[Chained Authentication]
in the _User Account and Authentication LDAP Integration_ GitHub documentation.
====

===== LDAP Role Mapping

The OAuth2 authentication server (UAA), provides comprehensive support
for https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/develop/docs/UAA-LDAP.md#scopes[mapping LDAP groups to OAuth scopes].

The following options exist:

* `ldap/ldap-groups-null.xml` No groups will be mapped
* `ldap/ldap-groups-as-scopes.xml` Group names will be retrieved from an LDAP attribute. E.g. `CN`
* `ldap/ldap-groups-map-to-scopes.xml` Groups will be mapped to UAA groups using the external_group_mapping table

These values are specified via the configuration property `ldap.groups.file controls`. Under the covers
these values reference a Spring XML configuration file.

[TIP]
====
During test and development it might be necessary to make frequent changes
to LDAP groups and users and see those reflected in the UAA. However, user
information is cached for the duration of the login. The following script
helps to retrieve the updated information quickly:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
uaac token delete --all
uaac target http://localhost:8080/uaa
uaac token owner get cf <username> -s "" -p  <password>
uaac token client get admin -s adminsecret
uaac user get <username>
----

For more information and sample application, please see the following
https://github.com/ghillert/ldap-uaa-example[GitHub repository].
====

[[configuration-security-authentication-via-shell]]
==== Shell Authentication

When using traditional authentication with the Data Flow Shell, you typically provide
a username and password by using command-line arguments, as shown in the following example:

[source,bash, subs=attributes+]
----
$ java -jar target/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-{project-version}.jar  \
  --dataflow.username=myuser                                          \   # <1>
  --dataflow.password=mysecret                                            # <2>
----

<1> If authentication is enabled, the username must be provided.
<2> If the password is not provided, the shell prompts for it.

Alternatively, you can target a Data Flow Server also from within the shell, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
server-unknown:>dataflow config server
  --uri  http://localhost:9393                                        \   # <1>
  --username myuser                                                   \   # <2>
  --password mysecret                                                 \   # <3>
  --skip-ssl-validation  true                                         \   # <4>
----

<1> Optional, defaults to http://localhost:9393.
<2> Mandatory if security is enabled.
<3> If security is enabled, and the password is not provided, the user is prompted for it.
<4> Optional, ignores certificate errors (when using self-signed certificates). Use cautiously!

The following image shows a typical shell command to connect to and authenticate a Data
Flow Server:

[[customizing-authorization]]
==== Customizing Authorization

The preceding content deals with mostly with authentication - that is, how to assess the identity of the user. Irrespective of the option chosen, you can also customize *authorization* - that is,
who can do what.

The default scheme uses three roles to protect the xref:api-guide[REST endpoints]
that Spring Cloud Data Flow exposes:

* *ROLE_VIEW* for anything that relates to retrieving state
* *ROLE_CREATE* for anything that involves creating, deleting, or mutating the state of the system
* *ROLE_MANAGE* for boot management endpoints

All of those defaults are specified in `dataflow-server-defaults.yml`, which is
part of the Spring Cloud Data Flow Core Module. Nonetheless, you can
override those, if desired - for example, in `application.yml`. The configuration takes
the form of a YAML list (as some rules may have precedence over others). Consequently,
you need to copy and paste the whole list and tailor it to your needs (as there is no way to merge lists).

NOTE: Always refer to your version of `application.yml`, as the following snippet may be outdated.

The default rules are as follows:

[source,yaml]
----

  cloud:
    dataflow:
      security:
        authorization:

The format of each line is the following:
----
HTTP_METHOD URL_PATTERN '=>' SECURITY_ATTRIBUTE
----

where

* HTTP_METHOD is one http method, capital case
* URL_PATTERN is an Ant style URL pattern
* SECURITY_ATTRIBUTE is a SpEL expression.  See http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#el-access[Expression-Based Access Control].
* Each of those separated by one or several blank characters (spaces, tabs, and so on)

Be mindful that the above is indeed a YAML list, not a map (thus the use of '-' dashes at the start of each line) that lives under the `spring.cloud.dataflow.security.authorization.rules` key.

[[authorization-shell-and-dashboard]]
==== Authorization - Shell and Dashboard Behavior

When security is enabled, the dashboard and the shell are role-aware,
meaning that, depending on the assigned roles, not all functionality may be visible.

For instance, shell commands for which the user does not have the necessary roles
are marked as unavailable.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, the shell's `help` command lists commands that are unavailable.
Please track the following issue: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-shell/issues/115
====

Similarly, for the Dashboard, the UI does not show pages or page elements for
which the user is not authorized.

[[configuration-monitoring-management]]
== Monitoring and Management
The Spring Cloud Data Flow server is a Spring Boot 1.5 application that includes the  {spring-boot-docs-reference}/htmlsingle/#production-ready[Actuator
library], which adds several production ready features to help you monitor and manage your application.

The Actuator library adds HTTP endpoints under the context path `/management` which is a discovery page for available managerment endpoints.
For example, there is a `health` endpoint that shows application health information and an `env` that lists properties from Spring's `ConfigurableEnvironment`.
By default, only the health and application info endpoints are accessible.  The other endpoints are considered to be sensitive
and need to be  {spring-boot-docs-reference}/htmlsingle/#production-ready-customizing-endpoints[enabled explicitly via configuration].
If you enable sensitive endpoints, you should also <<configuration-security,secure the Data Flow server's endpoints>> so that information is not inadvertently exposed to unauthenticated users.
The local Data Flow server has security disabled by default, so all actuator endpoints are available.

The Data Flow server requires a relational database, and, if the feature toggle for analytics is enabled, a Redis server is also required.
The Data Flow server autoconfigures the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v{spring-boot-version}/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/DataSourceHealthIndicator.java[DataSourceHealthIndicator] and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v{spring-boot-version}/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/RedisHealthIndicator.java[RedisHealthIndicator] if needed.
The health of these two services is incorporated to the overall health status of the server through the `health` endpoint.


[[configuration-monitoring-deployed-applications]]
=== Monitoring Deployed Stream Applications

The stream applications deployed by Spring Cloud Data Flow can be based on Spring Boot 1.5 or Spring Boot 2.0.
 Both versions contains several features for monitoring your application in production.
However, Spring Boot 1.x and 2.x as well as Spring Cloud Stream 1.x and 2.x differ in how monitoring is implemented.
Since Spring Cloud Data Flow supports deploying 1.x and 2.x applications, we will cover both cases individually.

What is common across 1.x and 2.x applications is that Spring Cloud Stream apps can be configured to publish metrics to a messaging middleware destination.
The https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-metrics-collector[Spring Cloud Data Flow Metrics Collector] subscribes to this destination and aggregates metrics into a stream based view.
The Metrics Collector 2.0 server supports collecting metrics from streams that contain only Boot 1.x or 2.x apps as well as streams that contain a mixture of Boot versions.
The Data Flow UI queries the Metrics collector over HTTP to display messages rates next to each deployed application.

The following image shows the architecture when using Spring Cloud Stream's metrics publisher, the Metrics Collector, and the Data Flow server:

.Spring Cloud Data Flow Metrics Architecture
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-metrics-arch.png[Spring Cloud Data Flow Metrics Architecture , scaledwidth="100%"]


==== Using the Metrics Collector

There are two versions of the Metrics Collector, a 1.0 version based on Spring Boot 1.0 that understands how to aggregate metrics from Spring Boot 1.x applications and a 2.0 version based on Spring Boot 2.0 that understands how to aggregate metrics from Spring Boot 1.x and 2.x.
There is a Metrics Collector server for Rabbit and Kafka.
You can find more information on downloading and running the Metrics Collector on its https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-metrics-collector[project page].


The Data Flow server property: `spring.cloud.dataflow.metrics.collector.uri` references the URI the Metrics Collector.
For example, if you run the Metrics Collector locally on port `8080`, this is how you start local Data Flow server to reference the Metrics Collector.

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-{project-version}.jar --spring.cloud.dataflow.metrics.collector.uri=http://localhost:8080
----

The Metrics Collector can be secured with 'basic' authentication that requires a username and password.
To set the username and password, use the properties `spring.cloud.dataflow.metrics.collector.username` and `spring.cloud.dataflow.metrics.collector.password` when starting the Data Flow server.

The metrics for each application are published when the property `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination` is set.
Using a destination name of `metrics` is a good choice as the Metrics Collector subscribes to that name by default.

Since it is quite common to want all stream applications deployed by Data Flow to emit metrics, setting the property:
[source,bash]
----
spring.cloud.dataflow.applicationProperties.stream.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination=metrics

on the Data Flow server will let you configure support for metrics publication in one central location.

Using a destination name of `metrics` is a good choice as the Metrics Collector subscribes to that name by default, which of course, can be overridden to be different than the default as needed.

The next most common way to configure the metrics destination is to use
deployment properties.  The following example shows the `ticktock` stream that
uses the App Starters `time` and `log` applications:

[source,bash]
----
app register --name time --type source --uri maven://org.springframework.cloud.stream.app:time-source-rabbit:1.2.0.RELEASE

app register --name log --type sink --uri maven://org.springframework.cloud.stream.app:log-sink-rabbit:1.2.0.RELEASE

stream create --name foostream --definition "time | log"

stream deploy --name foostream --properties "app.*.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination=metrics"
----

The Metrics Collector exposes aggregated metrics under the HTTP endpoint `/collector/metrics` in JSON format.
The Data Flow server accesses this endpoint in two distinct ways.
The first is by exposing a `/metrics/streams` HTTP endpoint that acts as a proxy to the Metrics Collector endpoint.
This is accessed by the UI when overlaying message rates on SCDF's Flo and it's visual representation of streaming pipelines.
It is also accessed to enrich the Data Flow `/runtime/apps` endpoint that is exposed in the UI in the `Runtime` tab and in the shell through the `runtime apps` command with message rates.

The following image shows the message rates as they appear in the Streams tab of the UI:

.Stream Message Rates

When deploying applications, Data Flow sets the `spring.cloud.stream.metrics.properties` property, as shown
in the following example:

[source,bash]
----
spring.cloud.stream.metrics.properties=spring.application.name,spring.application.index,spring.cloud.application.*,spring.cloud.dataflow.*
----
The values of these keys are used as the tags to perform aggregation.
In the case of 2.x applications, these key-values map directly onto tags in the https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer library].
The property `spring.cloud.application.guid` can be used to track back to the specific application instance that generated the metric.
The `guid` value is platform-dependent.

Data Flow also sets the application property that controls which metric values are exported.
For 1.x applications, the property is `spring.metrics.export.triggers.application.includes` and the default value is is shown below:

[source,bash]
----
spring.metrics.export.triggers.application.includes=integration**
----

For 2.x applications, the property is `spring.cloud.stream.metrics.meter-filter` and it does not have a default value, so all metrics are exported.

Note that the Data Flow UI only displays instantaneous input and output channel message rates.
Data Flow does not provide its own implementation to store and visualize historical metrics data, instead we integrate with existing monitoring systems.
For Boot 1.x, there is support for sending metrics to the application log and https://www.datadoghq.com/[Datadog].
For Boot 2.x, metrics is backed by the https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer library] that provides a wide range of {spring-boot-docs-reference}/htmlsingle/#production-ready-metrics[monitoring systems].


==== Spring Boot 2.x

We have developed a sample application that show how to modify the `time` and `log` applications and export metrics to InfluxDB using the micrometer library.  A Grafana front end is also provided.
This is a WIP, so check the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-samples[Spring Cloud Data Flow Samples Repository] for the latest status.

==== Spring Boot 1.x

Each deployed application contains {spring-boot-docs-reference}/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints[web endpoints] for monitoring and interacting with Stream and Task applications.

In particular, the `/metrics` {spring-boot-docs-reference}/htmlsingle/#production-ready-metrics[endpoint] contains counters and gauges for HTTP requests, System Metrics such as JVM stats, DataSource Metrics, and Message Channel Metrics.
Spring Boot lets you {spring-boot-docs-reference}/htmlsingle/#production-ready-public-metrics[add your own metrics] to the `/metrics` endpoint either by registering an implementation of the `PublicMetrics` interface or through its integration with {spring-boot-docs-reference}/htmlsingle/#production-ready-dropwizard-metrics[Dropwizard].

The Spring Boot interfaces, `MetricWriter` and `Exporter`, are used to send the metrics data to a place where they can be displayed and analyzed.
There are implementations in Spring Boot to export metrics to Redis, Open TSDB, Statsd, and JMX.

A few additional Spring projects provide support for sending metrics data to external systems:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-metrics[Spring Cloud Data Flow Metrics] provides `LogMetricWriter` that writes to the log.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-metrics-datadog[Spring Cloud Data Flow Metrics Datadog Metrics] provides `DatadogMetricWriter` that writes to https://www.datadoghq.com/[Datadog].

To make use of this functionality, you need to build the Stream application with the additional pom dependency of the MetricWriter implementation you want to use.
To customize the "`out of the box`" Stream applications, use the http://start-scs.cfapps.io/[Spring Cloud Stream Initializr] to generate a project and then modify the pom.
The documentation on the Data Flow Metrics project pages provides the additional information you need to get started.

== About Configuration
The Spring Cloud Data Flow About Restful API result contains a display name,
version, and, if specified, a URL for each of the major dependencies that
comprise Spring Cloud Data Flow.  The result (if enabled) also contains the
sha1 and or sha256 checksum values for the shell dependency. The information
that is returned for each of the dependencies is configurable by setting the following
properties:

* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-core.name: the
name to be used for the core.
* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-core.version:
the version to be used for the core.
* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-dashboard.name: the
name to be used for the dashboard.
* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-dashboard.version:
the version to be used for the dashboard.
* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-implementation.name: the
name to be used for the implementation.
* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-implementation.version:
the version to be used for the implementation.
* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.name: the
name to be used for the shell.
* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.version:
the version to be used for the shell.
* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.url:
the URL to be used for downloading the shell dependency.
* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.checksum-sha1: the sha1
checksum value that is returned with the shell dependency info.
* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.checksum-sha256:
the sha256 checksum value that is returned with the shell dependency info.
* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.checksum-sha1-url:
if the `spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.checksum-sha1`
is not specified, SCDF uses the contents of the file specified at this URL for the checksum.
* spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.checksum-sha256-url:
if the `spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.checksum-sha256`
is not specified, SCDF uses the contents of the file specified at this URL for the checksum.

=== Enabling Shell Checksum values
By default, checksum values are not displayed for the shell dependency. If
you need this feature enabled, set the
`spring.cloud.dataflow.version-info.dependency-fetch.enabled` property to true.

=== Reserved Values for URLs
There are reserved values (surrounded by curly braces) that you can insert into
the URL that will make sure that the links are up to date:

* repository: if using a build-snapshot, milestone, or release candidate of
Data Flow, the repository refers to the repo-spring-io repository. Otherwise, it
refers to Maven Central.
* version: Inserts the version of the jar/pom.

For example,
`https://myrepository/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/\{version}/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-\{version}.jar`
produces
`https://myrepository/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/1.2.3.RELEASE/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.2.3.RELEASE.jar`
if you were using the 1.2.3.RELEASE version of the Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell
