If you're just getting started with Spring Cloud Data Flow, this is the section
for you! Here we answer the basic "`what?`", "`how?`" and "`why?`" questions. You'll
find a gentle introduction to Spring Cloud Data Flow along with installation instructions.
We'll then build our first Spring Cloud Data Flow application, discussing some core principles as
we go.

[[getting-started-system-requirements]]
== System Requirements

You need Java installed (Java 7 or better, we recommend Java 8) and to build you need to have Maven installed as well.

You also need to have link:http://redis.io/[Redis] installed and running if you plan on running a local system, or to run the included tests.

[[getting-started-building-spring-cloud-dataflow]]
== Building Spring Cloud Data Flow

Start Redis:

    cd  $REDIS_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/src
    ./redis-server

Clone the GitHub repository:

    git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow.git

Switch to the project directory:

    cd spring-cloud-dataflow

Start a local Redis server to support testing:

    redis-server

Build the project:

    mvn clean install -s .settings.xml

== Deploying Spring Cloud Data Flow

=== Deploying 'local'

[start=1]
<<<<<<< HEAD
1. download the Spring Cloud Data Flow Admin and Shell apps:

```
wget http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-1.0.0.M1.jar
wget http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.0.0.M1.jar
```
[start=2]
2. launch the admin:

```
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-1.0.0.M1.jar
```

[start=3]
3. launch the shell:

```
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.0.0.M1.jar
```

thus far, only the following commands are supported in the shell when running singlenode:

* `stream list`
* `stream create`
* `stream deploy`

=== Deploying on Lattice

[start=1]
1. start Redis on Lattice (running as root):

```
ltc create redis redis -r
```

[start=2]
2. launch the admin, with a mapping for port 9393 and extra memory (the default is 128MB):

```
ltc create admin springcloud/dataflow-admin -p 9393 -m 512
```

[start=3]
3. launching the shell is the same as above, but once running must be
configured to point to the admin that is running on Lattice:

```
server-unknown:>admin config server http://admin.192.168.11.11.xip.io
Successfully targeted http://admin.192.168.11.11.xip.io
dataflow:>
```

all stream commands are supported in the shell when running on Lattice:

* `stream list`
* `stream create`
* `stream deploy`
* `stream undeploy`
* `stream all undeploy`
* `stream destroy`
* `stream all destroy`

=== Deploying on Cloud Foundry

Spring Cloud Data Flow can be used to deploy modules in a Cloud Foundry environment. When doing so, the [Admin](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin) application can either run itself on Cloud Foundry, or on another installation (e.g. a simple laptop).

The required configuration amounts to the same in either case, and is merely related to providing credentials to the Cloud Foundry instance so that the admin can spawn applications itself. Any Spring Boot compatible configuration mechanism can be used (passing program arguments, editing configuration files before building the application, using [Spring Cloud Config](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config), using environment variables, etc.), although some may prove more practicable than others when running _on_ Cloud Foundry.

[start=1]
1. provision a redis service instance on Cloud Foundry.
Use `cf marketplace` to discover which plans are available to you, depending on the details of your Cloud Foundry setup. For example when using [Pivotal Web Services](https://run.pivotal.io/):

```
cf create-service rediscloud 30mb redis
```

[start=2]
2. download the Spring Cloud Data Flow Admin and Shell apps:

```
wget http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-1.0.0.M1.jar
wget http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.0.0.M1.jar
```

[start=3a]
3a. push the admin application on Cloud Foundry, configure it (see below) and start it

NOTE: You must use a unique name for your app; an app with the same name in the same organization will cause your deployment to fail

```
cf push s-c-dataflow-admin --no-start -p spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-1.0.0.M1.jar
cf bind-service s-c-dataflow-admin redis
```

Now we can configure the app. This configuration is for Pivotal Web Services. You need to fill in {org}, \{space}, {email} and {password} before running these commands.

NOTE: Only set 'Skip SSL Validation' to true if you're running on a Cloud Foundry instance using self-signed certs (e.g. in development). Do not use for production.

```
cf set-env s-c-dataflow-admin CLOUDFOUNDRY_API_ENDPOINT https://api.run.pivotal.io
cf set-env s-c-dataflow-admin CLOUDFOUNDRY_ORGANIZATION {org}
cf set-env s-c-dataflow-admin CLOUDFOUNDRY_SPACE {space}
cf set-env s-c-dataflow-admin CLOUDFOUNDRY_DOMAIN cfapps.io
cf set-env s-c-dataflow-admin CLOUDFOUNDRY_SERVICES redis
cf set-env s-c-dataflow-admin CLOUDFOUNDRY_USERNAME {email}
cf set-env s-c-dataflow-admin CLOUDFOUNDRY_PASSWORD {password}
cf set-env s-c-dataflow-admin CLOUDFOUNDRY_SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION false
```

We are now ready to start the app.

```
cf start s-c-dataflow-admin
```

Alternatively,

[start=3b]
3b. run the admin application locally, targeting your Cloud Foundry installation (see below for configuration)

```
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-1.0.0.M1.jar [--option1=value1] [--option2=value2] [etc.]
```

[start=4]
4. run the shell and optionally target the Admin application if not running on the same host (will typically be the case if deployed on Cloud Foundry as **3a.**)

```
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.0.0.M1.jar
```

```
server-unknown:>admin config server http://s-c-dataflow-admin.cfapps.io
Successfully targeted http://s-c-dataflow-admin.cfapps.io
dataflow:>
```

At step **3b.** the following pieces of configuration must be provided, e.g. by setting the local environment, or passing variables on the Java invocation:

```
# Default values cited after the equal sign.
# Example values, typical for Pivotal Web Services, cited as a comment

# url of the CF API (used when using cf login -a for example), e.g. https://api.run.pivotal.io
# (for setting env var use CLOUDFOUNDRY_API_ENDPOINT)
cloudfoundry.apiEndpoint=

# name of the organization that owns the space above, e.g. youruser-org
# (for setting env var use CLOUDFOUNDRY_ORGANIZATION)
cloudfoundry.organization=

# name of the space into which modules will be deployed
# (for setting env var use CLOUDFOUNDRY_SPACE)
cloudfoundry.space=<same space as admin when running on CF, or 'development'>

# the root domain to use when mapping routes, e.g. cfapps.io
# (for setting env var use CLOUDFOUNDRY_DOMAIN)
cloudfoundry.domain=

# Comma separated set of service instance names to bind to the module.
# Amongst other things, this should include a service that will be used
# for Spring Cloud Stream binding
# (for setting env var use CLOUDFOUNDRY_SERVICES)
cloudfoundry.services=redis

# username and password of the user to use to create apps (modules)
# (for setting env var use CLOUDFOUNDRY_USERNAME and CLOUDFOUNDRY_PASSWORD)
cloudfoundry.username=
cloudfoundry.password=

# Whether to allow self-signed certificates during SSL validation
# (for setting env var use CLOUDFOUNDRY_SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION)
cloudfoundry.skipSslValidation=false
```

=== Deploying on YARN

Currently the YARN configuration is set to use `localhost`, meaning this can only be run against a local cluster. Also, all commands shown here need to be run from the project root.

[start=1]
1. download the Spring Cloud Data Flow YARN and Shell apps:

```
wget http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-yarn-appmaster/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-dataflow-yarn-appmaster-1.0.0.M1.jar
wget http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-yarn-container/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-dataflow-yarn-container-1.0.0.M1.jar
wget http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-yarn-client/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-dataflow-yarn-client-1.0.0.M1.jar
wget http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-1.0.0.M1.jar
wget http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.0.0.M1.jar
```

[start=2]
2. start Redis locally via `redis-server`

[start=3]
3. optionally wipe existing data on `hdfs`

```
$ hdfs dfs -rm -R /app/app
```

[start=4]
4. start `spring-cloud-dataflow-admin` with `yarn` profile

```
$ java -Dspring.profiles.active=yarn -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-1.0.0.M1.jar
```

[start=5]
5. start `spring-cloud-dataflow-shell`

```
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.0.0.M1.jar

dataflow:>stream create --name "ticktock" --definition "time --fixedDelay=5|log" --deploy

dataflow:>stream list
  Stream Name  Stream Definition        Status
  -----------  -----------------------  --------
  ticktock     time --fixedDelay=5|log  deployed

dataflow:>stream destroy --name "ticktock"
Destroyed stream 'ticktock'
```

YARN application is pushed and started automatically during a stream deployment process. This application instance is not automatically closed which can be done from CLI:

```
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-yarn-client-1.0.0.M1.jar shell
Spring YARN Cli (v2.3.0.M2)
Hit TAB to complete. Type 'help' and hit RETURN for help, and 'exit' to quit.

```

Properties `dataflow.yarn.app.appmaster.path` and `dataflow.yarn.app.container.path` can be used with both `spring-cloud-dataflow-admin` and `and spring-cloud-dataflow-yarn-client` to define directory for `appmaster` and `container` jars. Values for those default to `.` which then assumes all needed jars are in a same working directory.
