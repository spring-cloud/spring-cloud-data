If you are getting started with Spring Cloud Data Flow, this section is for you.
In this section, we answer the basic "`what?`", "`how?`" and "`why?`" questions.
You can find a gentle introduction to Spring Cloud Data Flow along with installation instructions.
We then build an introductory Spring Cloud Data Flow application, discussing some core principles as we go.

[[getting-started-system-requirements]]
== System Requirements

You need Java 8 to run and to build you need to have Maven.

You need to have an RDBMS for storing stream definition and deployment properites and task/batch job states.
By default, the Data Flow server uses embedded H2 database for this purpose but you can easily configure the server to use another external database.

You also need to have link:https://redis.io[Redis] running if you are running any streams that involve analytics applications. Redis may also be required to run the unit/integration tests.

For the deployed streams applications communicate, either link:http://www.rabbitmq.com[RabbitMQ] or link:http://kafka.apache.org[Kafka] needs to be installed.

If you would like to have the feature of upgrading and rolling back applications in Streams at runtime, you should install the Spring Cloud Skipper server.


[[getting-started-deploying-spring-cloud-dataflow-docker]]
== Getting Started with Docker Compose

As of Spring Cloud Data Flow 1.4, a Docker Compose file is provided to quickly bring up Spring Cloud Data Flow and its dependencies without having to obtain them manually.
When running, a composed system includes the latest GA release of Spring Cloud Data Flow Local Server using the Kafka binder for communication.
Docker Compose is required and it's recommended to use the link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[latest version].

. Download the Spring Cloud Data Flow Local Server Docker Compose file:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/{github-tag}/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local/docker-compose.yml
----

NOTE: If the `wget` command is unavailable, `curl` or another platform specific utility may be used. Alternatively navigate to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/{github-tag}/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local/docker-compose.yml[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/{github-tag}/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local/docker-compose.yml] in a web browser and save the contents. Ensure the downloaded filename is `docker-compose.yml`.

. Start Docker Compose
+
In the directory where you downloaded `docker-compose.yml`, start the system, as follows:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ export DATAFLOW_VERSION={local-server-image-tag}
$ docker-compose up
----
+
The `docker-compose.yml` file defines a variable `DATAFLOW_VERSION` so that it can be changed easily. The above commands first set the `DATAFLOW_VERSION` to use in the environment and then `docker-compose` is started.
+
A shorthand version which only exposes the `DATAFLOW_VERSION` variable the `docker-compose` process rather than setting it in the environment would be as follows:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ DATAFLOW_VERSION={local-server-image-tag} docker-compose up
----
+
When using Windows, environment variables are defined by using the `set` command. To start the system on Windows, enter the following commands:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
C:\ set DATAFLOW_VERSION={local-server-image-tag}
C:\ docker-compose up
----
+
NOTE: By default Docker Compose will use locally available images.
If for example when using the `latest` tag, execute `docker-compose pull` prior to `docker-compose up` to ensure the latest image is downloaded.
+
. Launch the Spring Cloud Data Flow Dashboard
+
Spring Cloud Data Flow will be ready for use once the `docker-compose` command stops emitting log messages.
At this time, in your browser navigate to the link:http://localhost:9393/dashboard[Spring Cloud Data Flow Dashboard].
By default the latest GA releases of Stream and Task applications will be imported automatically.
+
. Create a Stream
+
To create a stream, first navigate to the "Streams" menu link then click the "Create Stream" link.
Enter `time | log` into the "Create Stream" textarea then click the "CREATE STREAM" button.
Enter "ticktock" for the stream name and click the "Deploy Stream(s) checkbox as show in the following image:
+
.Creating a Stream
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-stream-create.png[Creating a Stream, scaledwidth="60%"]
+
Then click "OK" which will return back to the Definitions page.
The stream will be in "deploying" status and move to "deployed" when finished.
You may need to refresh your browser to see the updated status.
+
. View Stream Logs
+
To view the stream logs, navigate to the "Runtime" menu link and click the "ticktock.log" link.
Copy the path in the "stdout" text box on the dashboard and in another console type:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ docker exec -it dataflow-server tail -f /path/from/stdout/textbox/in/dashboard
----
+
You should now see the output of the log sink, printing a timestamp once per second.
Press CTRL+c to end the `tail`.
+
. Delete a Stream
+
To delete the stream, first navigate to the "Streams" menu link in the dashboard then click the checkbox on the "ticktock" row.
Click the "DESTROY ALL 1 SELECTED STREAMS" button and then "YES" to destroy the stream.
+
. Destroy the Quick Start environment
+
To destroy the Quick Start environment, in another console from where the `docker-compose.yml` is located, type as follows:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ docker-compose down
----
+


[[getting-started-customizing-spring-cloud-dataflow-docker]]
=== Docker Compose Customization

Out of the box Spring Cloud Data Flow will use the H2 embedded database for storing state, Kafka for communication and no analytics.
Customizations can be made to these components by editing the `docker-compose.yml` file as described below.

. To use MySQL rather than the H2 embedded database, add the following configuration under the `services` section:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
  mysql:
    image: mariadb:10.2
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: dataflow
      MYSQL_USER: root
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpw
    expose:
      - 3306
----
+
The following entries need to be added to the `environment` block of the `dataflow-server` service definition:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
      - spring_datasource_url=jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/dataflow
      - spring_datasource_username=root
      - spring_datasource_password=rootpw
      - spring_datasource_driver-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
----
+
Update the `depends_on` attribute of the `dataflow-server` service definition to include:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
      - mysql
----
+

. To use RabbitMQ instead of Kafka for communication, replace the following configuration under the `services` section:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
  kafka:
    image: wurstmeister/kafka:0.10.1.0
    expose:
      - "9092"
    environment:
      - KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PORT=9092
      - KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:2181
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
  zookeeper:
    image: wurstmeister/zookeeper
    expose:
      - "2181"
    environment:
      - KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME=zookeeper
----
+
With:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3.7
    expose:
      - "5672"
----
+
In the `dataflow-server` services configuration block, add the following `environment` entry:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
      - spring.cloud.dataflow.applicationProperties.stream.spring.rabbitmq.host=rabbitmq
----
+
Then replace:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
    depends_on:
      - kafka
----
+
With:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
    depends_on:
      - rabbitmq
----
+
And finally, modify the `app-import` service definition `command` attribute to replace `http://bit.ly/Celsius-SR2-stream-applications-kafka-10-maven` with `http://bit.ly/Celsius-SR2-stream-applications-rabbit-maven`.


. To enable analytics using redis as a backend, add the following configuration under the `services` section:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
  redis:
    image: redis:2.8
    expose:
      - "6379"
----
+
Update the `depends_on` attribute of the `dataflow-server` service definition to include:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
      - redis
----
+
Then add the following entries to the `environment` block of the `dataflow-server` service definition:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
      - spring.cloud.dataflow.applicationProperties.stream.spring.redis.host=redis
      - spring_redis_host=redis
----
+


[[getting-started-deploying-spring-cloud-dataflow]]
== Getting Started with Manual Installation

. Download the Spring Cloud Data Flow Server and Shell apps:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
wget https://repo.spring.io/{version-type-lowercase}/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local/{project-version}/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-{project-version}.jar

wget https://repo.spring.io/{version-type-lowercase}/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/{project-version}/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-{project-version}.jar
----
+
Starting 1.3.x, the Data Flow Server can run in either the  `skipper` or `classic` mode.
The `classic` mode is how the Data Flow Server worked in the 1.2.x releases.
The mode is specified when starting the Data Flow server using the property `spring.cloud.dataflow.features.skipper-enabled`.
By default, the `classic` mode is enabled.
+
. Download http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-skipper/[Skipper] if you would like the added features of upgrading and rolling back applications inside Streams, since Data Flow delegates to Skipper for those features.
+
[source,yaml,options=nowrap,subs=attributes]
----
wget https://repo.spring.io/{skipper-version-type-lowercase}/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-skipper-server/{skipper-version}/spring-cloud-skipper-server-{skipper-version}.jar

wget https://repo.spring.io/{skipper-version-type-lowercase}/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-skipper-shell/{skipper-version}/spring-cloud-skipper-shell-{skipper-version}.jar
----
+
. Launch Skipper (Required only if you want to run Spring Cloud Data Flow server in `skipper` mode)
+
In the directory where you downloaded Skipper, run the server using `java -jar`, as follows:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-server-{skipper-version}.jar
----
+
. Launch the Data Flow Server
+
In the directory where you downloaded Data Flow, run the server using `java -jar`, as follows:
+
To run the Data Flow server in `classic` mode:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-{project-version}.jar
----
+
To run the Data Flow server in `skipper` mode:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-{project-version}.jar --spring.cloud.dataflow.features.skipper-enabled=true
----
+
If Skipper and the Data Flow server are not running on the same host, set the configuration property `spring.cloud.skipper.client.serverUri` to the location of Skipper, e.g.
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-{project-version}.jar --spring.cloud.skipper.client.serverUri=http://192.51.100.1:7577/api
----
+
. Launch the Data Flow Shell, as follows:
+
Launching the Data Flow shell requires the appropriate data flow server mode to be specified.
To start the Data Flow Shell for the Data Flow server running in `classic` mode:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-{project-version}.jar
----
+
To start the Data Flow Shell for the Data Flow server running in `skipper` mode:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-{project-version}.jar --dataflow.mode=skipper
----
+
NOTE: Both the Data Flow Server and the Shell must be on the same mode.
+
If the Data Flow Server and shell are not running on the same host, you can also point the shell to the Data Flow server URL using the `dataflow config server` command when in the shell's interactive mode.
+
If the Data Flow Server and shell are not running on the same host, point the shell to the Data Flow server URL, as follows:
+
[source,bash]
----
server-unknown:>dataflow config server http://198.51.100.0
Successfully targeted http://198.51.100.0
dataflow:>
----
+
Alternatively, pass in the command line option `--dataflow.uri`.  The shell's command line option `--help` shows what is available.

[[getting-started-deploying-streams-spring-cloud-dataflow]]
== Deploying Streams
. Register Stream Apps
+
By default, the application registry is empty.
As an example, register two applications, `http` and `log`, that communicate by using RabbitMQ.
+
```
dataflow:>app register --name http --type source --uri maven://org.springframework.cloud.stream.app:http-source-rabbit:1.2.0.RELEASE
Successfully registered application 'source:http'

dataflow:>app register --name log --type sink --uri maven://org.springframework.cloud.stream.app:log-sink-rabbit:1.1.0.RELEASE
Successfully registered application 'sink:log'
```
+
For more details, such as how to register applications that are based on docker containers or use Kafka as the messaging middleware, review the section on how to <<streams.adoc#spring-cloud-dataflow-register-stream-apps, register applications>>.
+
NOTE: Depending on your environment, you may need to configure the Data Flow Server to point to a custom
Maven repository location or configure proxy settings.  See <<configuration-maven>> for more information.
+
In this getting started section, we only show deploying a stream, so the commands are the same in `skipper` as well as `classic` mode of the server.
+
. Create a stream
+
Use the `stream create` command to create a stream with a `http` source and a `log` sink and deploy it:
+
[source,bash]
----
dataflow:> stream create --name httptest --definition "http --server.port=9000 | log" --deploy
----
+
NOTE: You need to wait a little while, until the apps are actually deployed successfully, before posting data.
Look in the log file of the Data Flow server for the location of the log files for the `http` and `log` applications.
Use the `tail` command on the log file for each application to verify that the application has started.
+
Now post some data, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,bash]
----
dataflow:> http post --target http://localhost:9000 --data "hello world"
----
Check to see if `hello world` ended up in log files for the `log` application.
The location of the log file for the `log` application will be shown in the Data Flow server's log.

You can read more about the general features of using Skipper to deploy streams in the section <<spring-cloud-dataflow-stream-lifecycle-skipper>> and how to upgrade and rollback streams in <<spring-cloud-dataflow-streams-skipper>>.

[NOTE]
====
When deploying locally, each app (and each app instance, in case of `count > 1`) gets a dynamically assigned `server.port`, unless you explicitly assign one with `--server.port=x`.
In both cases, this setting is propagated as a configuration property that overrides any lower-level setting that you may have used (for example, in `application.yml` files).
====

== Deploying Tasks
In this getting started section, we show how to register a task, create a task definition and then launch it.
We will then also review information about the task executions.

NOTE: Launching Spring Cloud Task applications are not delegated to Skipper since they are short lived applications.  Tasks are alwasy deployed directly via the Data Flow Server.

. Register a Task App
+
By default, the application registry is empty.
As an example, we will register one task application, `timestamp` which simply prints the current time to the log.
+
[source,bash]
----
dataflow:>app register --name timestamp --type task --uri maven://org.springframework.cloud.task.app:timestamp-task:1.3.0.RELEASE
Successfully registered application 'task:timestamp'
----
+
NOTE: Depending on your environment, you may need to configure the Data Flow Server to point to a custom
Maven repository location or configure proxy settings.  See <<configuration-maven>> for more information.
+
. Create a Task Definition
+
Use the `task create` command to create a task definition using the previously registered `timestamp` application.
In this example, no additional properties are used to configure the `timestamp` application.
+
[source,bash]
----
dataflow:> task create --name printTimeStamp --definition "timestamp"
----
+
. Launch a Task
+
The launching of task definitions is done through the shell's `task launch` command.
+
[source,bash]
----
dataflow:> task launch printTimeStamp
----
+
Check to see if the a timestamp ended up in log file for the timestamp task.
The location of the log file for the task application will be shown in the Data Flow server’s log.
You should see a log entry similar to
+
[source,bash]
----
TimestampTaskConfiguration$TimestampTask : 2018-02-28 16:42:21.051
----
+
. Review task execution
+
Information about the task execution can be obtained using the command `task execution list`.
+
[source,bash]
