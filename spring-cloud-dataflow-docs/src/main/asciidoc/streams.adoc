== Introduction

In Spring Cloud Data Flow, a basic stream defines the ingestion of event driven data from a _source_ to a _sink_ that passes through any number of _processors_. Streams are composed of spring-cloud-stream modules and the deployment of stream definitions is done via the Data Flow Server (REST API). The xref:getting-started#getting-started[Getting Started] section shows you how to start these servers and how to start and use the Spring Cloud Data Flow shell.

A high level DSL is used to create stream definitions. The DSL to define a stream that has an http source and a file sink (with no processors) is shown below

```
http | file
```
The DSL mimics a UNIX pipes and filters syntax. Default values for ports and filenames are used in this example but can be overridden using `--` options, such as

```
http --port=8091 | file --dir=/tmp/httpdata/
```
To create these stream definitions you make an HTTP POST request to the Spring Cloud Data Flow Server. More details can be found in the sections below.

== Creating a Simple Stream

The Spring Cloud Data Flow Server exposes a full RESTful API for managing the lifecycle of stream definitions, but the easiest way to use is it is via the Spring Cloud Data Flow shell. Start the shell as described in the xref:Getting-Started#getting-started[Getting Started] section.

New streams are created by posting stream definitions. The definitions are built from a simple DSL. For example, let's walk through what happens if we execute the following shell command:

```
dataflow:> stream create --definition "time | log" --name ticktock
```
This defines a stream named `ticktock` based off the DSL expression `time | log`.  The DSL uses the "pipe" symbol `|`, to connect a source to a sink.

Then to deploy the stream execute the following shell command (or alternatively add the `--deploy` flag when creating the stream so that this step is not needed):

```
dataflow:> stream deploy --name ticktock
```
The Admin Server resolves `time` and `log` to maven coordinates and uses those to launch the `time` and `log` applications of the stream.  In this simple example, the time source simply sends the current time as a message each second, and the log sink outputs it using the logging framework.

```
2016-01-13 10:41:15.398  INFO 65275 --- [nio-9393-exec-1] o.s.c.d.a.s.l.OutOfProcessModuleDeployer : deploying module org.springframework.cloud.stream.module:log-sink:jar:exec:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT instance 0
   Logs will be in /var/folders/hs/h87zy7z17qs6mcnl4hj8_dp00000gp/T/spring-cloud-data-flow-3652850284472151116/ticktock.log
2016-01-13 10:41:15.433  INFO 65275 --- [nio-9393-exec-1] o.s.c.d.a.s.l.OutOfProcessModuleDeployer : deploying module org.springframework.cloud.stream.module:time-source:jar:exec:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT instance 0

```

If you would like to have multiple instances of a module in the stream, you can include a property with the deploy command:

```
dataflow:> stream deploy --name ticktock --properties "module.time.count=3"
```

IMPORTANT: See <<module-labels>>.

== Deleting a Stream

You can delete a stream by issuing the `stream destroy` command from the shell:

```
dataflow:> stream destroy --name ticktock
```

== Deploying and Undeploying Streams

Often you will want to stop a stream, but retain the name and definition for future use. In that case you can `undeploy` the stream by name and issue the `deploy` command at a later time to restart it.
```
dataflow:> stream undeploy --name ticktock
dataflow:> stream deploy --name ticktock
```

== Other Source and Sink Types

Let's try something a bit more complicated and swap out the `time` source for something else. Another supported source type is `http`, which accepts data for ingestion over HTTP POSTs. Note that the `http` source accepts data on a different port from the Data Flow Server (default 8080). By default the port is randomly assigned.

To create a stream using an `http` source, but still using the same `log` sink, we would change the original command above to

```
dataflow:> stream create --definition "http | log" --name myhttpstream --deploy
```
which will produce the following output from the server

```
2016-01-13 18:42:19.162  INFO 19463 --- [nio-9393-exec-7] o.s.c.d.a.s.l.OutOfProcessModuleDeployer : deploying module org.springframework.cloud.stream.module:log-sink:jar:exec:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT instance 0
   Logs will be in /var/folders/hs/h87zy7z17qs6mcnl4hj8_dp00000gp/T/spring-cloud-data-flow-2185888994718649403/myhttpstream.log
2016-01-13 18:42:19.180  INFO 19463 --- [nio-9393-exec-7] o.s.c.d.a.s.l.OutOfProcessModuleDeployer : deploying module org.springframework.cloud.stream.module:http-source:jar:exec:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT instance 0
   Logs will be in /var/folders/hs/h87zy7z17qs6mcnl4hj8_dp00000gp/T/spring-cloud-data-flow-2185888994718649403/myhttpstream.http
```

Note that we don't see anydefin other output this time until we actually post some data (using shell command). In order to see the randomly assigned port on which the http source is listening, execute:
```
dataflow:> runtime modules
```
You should see that the corresponding http source has a `url` property containing the host and port information on which it is listening. You are now ready to post to that url, e.g.:
```
dataflow:> http post --target http://localhost:1234 --data "hello"
dataflow:> http post --target http://localhost:1234 --data "goodbye"
```
and the stream will then funnel the data from the http source to the output log implemented by the log sink

```
2016-01-13 21:15:34.825  INFO 54348 --- [hannel-adapter1] log.sink                                 : hello
2016-01-13 21:17:36.544  INFO 54348 --- [hannel-adapter1] log.sink                                 : goodbye
```

Of course, we could also change the sink implementation. You could pipe the output to a file (`file`), to hadoop (`hdfs`) or to any of the other sink modules which are provided. You can also define your own modules.

== Simple Stream Processing

As an example of a simple processing step, we can transform the payload of the HTTP posted data to upper case using the stream definitions
```
http | transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | log
```
To create this stream enter the following command in the shell
```
dataflow:> stream create --definition "http | transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | log" --name mystream --deploy
```
Posting some data (using shell command)
```
dataflow:> http post --target http://localhost:1234 --data "hello"
```
Will result in an uppercased 'hello' in the log

```
15:18:21,345  WARN ThreadPoolTaskScheduler-1 logger.myprocstream:141 - HELLO
```

See the xref:processors#spring-cloud-stream-modules-processors[Processors] section for more information.

== DSL Syntax

In the examples above, we connected a source to a sink using the pipe symbol `|`. You can also pass parameters to the source and sink configurations. The parameter names will depend on the individual module implementations, but as an example, the `http` source module exposes a `server.port` setting which allows you to change the data ingestion port from the default value. To create the stream using port 8000, we would use
```
dataflow:> stream create --definition "http --server.port=8000 | log" --name myhttpstream
```
The shell provides tab completion for module parameters and also the shell command `module info` provides some additional documentation.  For more comprehensive documentation on module parameters, please see the xref:modules#modules[Modules] chapter.

=== Register a Stream App

Register a Stream App with the App Registry using the Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell
`module register` command. You must provide a unique name and a URI that can be
resolved to the app artifact. For the type, specify "source", "processor", or "sink".
Here are a few examples:

```
dataflow:>module register --name mysource --type source --uri maven://com.example:mysource:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

dataflow:>module register --name myprocessor --type processor --uri file:///Users/example/myprocessor-1.2.3.jar

dataflow:>module register --name mysink --type sink --uri http://example.com/mysink-2.0.1.jar
```

When providing a URI with the `maven` scheme, the format should conform to the following:

```
maven://<groupId>:<artifactId>[:<extension>[:<classifier>]]:<version>
```

If a stream app is already registered with the provided name and type, it will not be overridden by default.
If you would like to override the pre-existing stream app, then include the `--force` option.

[NOTE]
In some cases the Resource is resolved on the server side, whereas in others the
URI will be passed to a runtime container instance where it is resolved. Consult
the specific documentation of each Data Flow Server for more detail.

== Advanced Features

If directed graphs are needed instead of the simple linear streams described above, two features are relevant. First, named destinations may be used as a way to combine the output from multiple streams or for multiple consumers to share the output from a single stream.  This can be done using the DSL syntax `http > mydestination` or `mydestination > log`.  To learn more, refer to then section on Named Destinations.  Second, you may need to determine the output channel of a stream based on some information that is only known at runtime. To learn about such content-based routing, refer to the Dynamic Router section.

[[module-labels]]
== Module Labels

When a stream is comprised of multiple modules with the same name, they must be qualified with labels:
```
stream create --definition "http | firstLabel: transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | secondLabel: transform --expression=payload+'!' | log" --name myStreamWithLabels --deploy
```
[[tap-dsl]]
== Tap DSL

Taps can be created at various producer endpoints in a stream. For a stream like this:

```
stream create --definition "http | step1: transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | step2: transform --expression=payload+'!' | log" --name mainstream --deploy

```
taps can be created at the output of `http`, `step1` and `step2`.

To create a stream that acts as a 'tap' on another stream requires to specify the `source destination name` for the tap stream. The syntax for source destination name is:

```
`<stream-name>.<label/app-name>`
```
To create a tap at the output of `http` in the stream above, the source destination name is `mainstream.http`
To create a tap at the output of the first transform app in the stream above, the source destination name is `mainstream.step1`

The tap stream DSL looks like this:

```
stream create --definition ":mainstream.http > counter" --name tap_at_http --deploy

stream create --definition ":mainstream.step1 > jdbc" --name tap_at_step1_transformer --deploy
```

Note the colon (:) prefix before the destination names. The colon lets the parser parse this as the destination name instead of app name.

[[explicit-destination-names]]
== Connecting to explicit destination names at the broker

One can connect to a specific destination name located in the broker (Rabbit, Kafka etc.,) either at the `source` or at the `sink` position.

The following stream has the destination name at the `source` position:

```
stream create --definition ":myDestination > log" --name ingest_from_broker --deploy
```

This stream receives messages from the destination `myDestination` located at the broker and connects it to the `log` app.


The following stream has the destination name at the `sink` position:

```
stream create --definition "http > :myDestination" --name ingest_to_broker --deploy
```
This stream sends the messages from `http` app to the destination `myDestination` located at the broker.

From the above streams, notice that the `http` and `log` apps are interacting with each other via `broker` (through the destination `myDestination`) rather than having a pipe directly between `http` and `log` within a single stream.

It is also possible to connect two different destinations (`source` and `sink` positions) at the broker in a stream.

```
stream create --definition ":destination1 > :destination2" --name bridge_destinations --deploy
```

In the above stream, both the destinations (`destination1` and `destination2`) are located in the broker. The messages flow from the source destination to the sink destination via a `bridge` app that connects them.
