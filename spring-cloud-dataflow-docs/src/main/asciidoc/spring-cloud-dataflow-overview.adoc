== Introducing Spring Cloud Data Flow
Spring Cloud Data Flow is a cloud-native orchestration service for composable data microservices on modern runtimes. 

With Spring Cloud Data Flow, developers can create and orchestrate data pipelines for common use cases such as data ingest, real-time analytics, and data import/export.

Spring Cloud Data Flow is the cloud-native redesign of link:http://projects.spring.io/spring-xd/[Spring XD] – a project that aimed to simplify development of Big Data use-cases. The streaming and batch modules from Spring XD are refactored into Spring Boot link:http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-modules/[data microservice] applications that are now autonomous deployment units and they can "natively" run in modern runtimes such as Cloud Foundry, Apache YARN, Apache Mesos, and Kubernetes.

Spring Cloud Data Flow offers a collection of patterns and best practices for microservices-based distributed streaming and batch data pipelines. 

=== Features

* Orchestrate applications across a variety of distributed modern runtimes including: Cloud Foundry, Apache YARN, Apache Mesos, and Kubernetes
* Separate runtime dependencies backed by ‘spring profiles’
* Consume streaming and batch data microservices as maven or docker artifacts
* Create, unit-test, troubleshoot and manage data microservices in isolation
* Develop using: DSL, Shell, REST-APIs, Admin-UI, and Flo
* Take advantage of metrics, health checks, and remote management at each data microservice level
* Scale stream and batch pipelines without interrupting data flows


== Spring Cloud Data Flow Architecture

The architecture for Spring Cloud Data Flow is separated into a number of distinct components.

=== Components

The link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-core[Core]
domain model includes the concept of a **stream** that is a composition of spring-cloud-stream
apps in a linear pipeline from a *source* to a *sink*, optionally including *processor* apps
in between. The domain also includes the concept of a **task**, which may be any process that does
not run indefinitely, including link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch[Spring Batch] jobs.

The link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-registry[App Registry]
maintains the set of available apps, and their mappings to a URI.
For example, if relying on Maven coordinates, the URI would be of the format:
`maven://<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`

The link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-core[Data Flow Server Core]
provides the REST API and UI to be used in combination with an implementation of the Deployer SPI
when creating a Data Flow Server for a given deployment environment.

The link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell[Shell]
connects to the Data Flow Server's REST API and supports a DSL that simplifies the process of
defining a stream and managing its lifecycle.

Several Data Flow Server implementations exist, covering a range of runtime environments:

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local[Local] (intended for development only)

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry[Cloud Foundry]

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn[Apache Yarn]

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-mesos[Apache Mesos]

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-kubernetes[Kubernetes]

As mentioned above, the Spring Cloud Data Flow Server implementations all rely upon corresponding
implementations of the link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer[Spring Cloud Deployer]
SPI, which provides the abstraction layer for deploying the apps of a given stream or task. The
following are links to the deployer SPI projects that correspond to the Data Flow Servers listed above:

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer/tree/master/spring-cloud-deployer-local[Local]

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-cloudfoundry[Cloud Foundry]

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-yarn[Apache Yarn]

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-mesos[Apache Mesos]

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-kubernetes[Kubernetes]
