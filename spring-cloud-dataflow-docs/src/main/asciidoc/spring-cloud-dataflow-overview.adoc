[[dataflow-documentation-intro]]
== Introducing Spring Cloud Data Flow
A cloud native programming and operating model for composable data microservices on a structured platform. It allows developers to create, 
orchestrate and refactor data pipelines with a single programming model for common use cases like data ingest, real time analytics, and 
data import/export.

Spring Cloud Data Flow is the cloud native redesign of Spring XD - a project that aimed to simplify Big Data application development. Existing 
integration and batch modules are refactored as Spring Boot link:http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-modules/[data microservices] that are 
now autonomous deployment units – thus enabling them to take full advantage of environment capabilities "natively" and they can independently evolve in isolation.

Spring Cloud Data Flow defines the best practices for distributed stream and batch data processing.

=== Features

* Orchestrate applications across a variety of distributed runtime platforms including: Cloud Foundry, Lattice, and Apache YARN
* Separate runtime dependencies backed by ‘spring profiles’
* Consume stream and batch microservices as maven dependency and push it to production
* Develop using: DSL, Shell, REST-APIs, Admin-UI, and Flo
* Take advantage of metrics, health checks and remote management functionalities
* Scale stream and batch pipelines without interrupting data flows


== Spring Cloud Data Flow Architecture

The architecture for Spring Cloud Data Flow is separated into a number of distinct components.

=== Components

The link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-core[Core]
domain module includes the concept of a **stream** that is a composition of spring-cloud-stream
modules in a linear pipeline from a *source* to a *sink*, optionally including *processor* modules
in between. The domain also includes the concept of a **task**, which may be any process that does
not run indefinitely, including link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch[Spring Batch] jobs.

The link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-artifact-registry[Artifact Registry]
maintains the set of available modules, and their mappings to Maven coordinates.

The link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-module-deployer-spi[Module Deployer SPI] provides the abstraction layer for deploying the modules of a given stream across a variety of runtime environments, including:

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-local[Local]

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-cloudfoundry[Cloud Foundry]

* link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-yarn[Yarn]

The link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-admin-starter[Admin Starter] provides the REST API and UI for implementations of the Admin SPI.

The link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell[Shell] connects to the Admin's REST API and supports a DSL that simplifies the process of defining a stream and managing its lifecycle.
