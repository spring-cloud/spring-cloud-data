== Getting Started - Kubernetes

This section covers how to get started with Spring Cloud Data Flow running locally on Kubernetes. See the link:https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/[Kubernetes] section of the microsite for more information on installing Spring Cloud Data Flow on Kubernetes.

Once you have the Data Flow server installed on Kubernetes, you probably want to get started with orchestrating the deployment of readily available pre-built applications into a coherent streaming or batch data pipelines. We have guides to help you get started with both link:https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/stream-developer-guides/[Stream] and link:https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/batch-developer-guides/[Batch] processing.
