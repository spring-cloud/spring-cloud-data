This section goes into more detail about how you can work with
http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/[Spring Cloud Tasks]. It covers topics such as
creating and running task modules.

If you're just starting out with Spring Cloud Dataflow, you should probably read the
_<<getting-started.adoc#getting-started, Getting Started>>_ guide before diving into
this section.

== Introducing Spring Cloud Task
A task executes a process on demand.  In this case a task is a
http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] application that is annotated with
`@EnableTask`.  Hence a user launches a task that performs a certain process, once
complete the task ends. An example of a task would be a boot application that exports
data from a JDBC repository to an HDFS instance.  Tasks record the start time and the end
time as well as the boot exit code in a relational database. The task implementation is
based on the http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/[Spring Cloud Task] project.

== The Lifecycle of a task
Before we dive deeper into the details of creating Tasks, we need to understand the
typical lifecycle for tasks in the context of Spring Cloud Dataflow:

1. Register a Task Module
2. Create a Task Definition
3. Launch a Task
4. Task Execution
5. Destroy a Task Definition

=== Register a Task Module
Register a Task Module with the Module Registry using the Spring Cloud Dataflow Shell
`module register` command.

=== Create a Task Definition
Create a Task Definition from a Task Module by providing a definition name as well as
properties that apply to the task execution.  Creating a task definition can be done via
the restful API or the shell.  To create a task definition using the shell, use the
`task create` command to create the task definition.  For example:

```
dataflow:>task create mytask --definition "timestamp --format=\"yyyy\""
 Created new task 'mytask'
```

A listing of the current task definitions can be obtained via the restful API or the
shell.  To get the task definition list using the shell, use the `task list` command.

=== Launch an ad-hoc Task
An adhoc task can be launched via the restful API or via the shell.  To launch an ad-hoc
task via the shell use the `task launch` command.  For Example:

```
dataflow:>task launch mytask
 Launched task 'mytask'
```

=== Task Execution
Once the task is launched the state of the task is stored in a relational DB.  The state
includes:

* Task Name
* Start Time
* End Time
* Exit Code
* Exit Message
* Last Updated Time
* Parameters

A user can check the status of their task executions via the restful API or by the shell.
To view the latest task executions via the shell use the `task execution list` command.

To get a list of task executions for just one task definition, add `--name` and
the task definition name, for example `task execution list --name foo`.  To retrieve full
details for a task execution use the `task view` command with the id of the task execution
, for example `task view --id 549`.

=== Destroy a Task Definition
Destroying a Task Definition will remove the definition from the definition repository.
This can be done via the restful API or via the shell.  To destroy a task via the shell
use the `task destroy` command. For Example:

```
dataflow:>task destroy mytask
 Destroyed task 'mytask'
```

The task execution information for previously launched tasks for the definition will
remain in the task repository.

*Note:* This will not stop any currently executing tasks for this definition, this just
removes the definition.

== Task Repository

Out of the box Spring Cloud Dataflow offers an embedded instance of the H2 database.
The H2 is good for development purposes but is not recommended for production use.

=== Configuring the Task Execution Repository
To add a driver for the database that will store the Task Execution information, a
dependency for the driver will need to be added to a maven pom file and the
Spring Cloud Dataflow will need to be rebuilt.  Since Spring Cloud Dataflow is comprised of an SPI for
each environment it supports, please review the SPI's documentation on which POM should be
updated to add the dependency and how to build.  This document will cover how to setup the
dependency for local SPI.

==== Local

1. Open the spring-cloud-data-flow-admin-local/pom.xml in your IDE.
2. In the `dependencies` section add the dependency for the database driver required.  In
the sample below postgresql has been chosen.
```
<dependencies>
...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
        <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
    </dependency>
...
</dependencies>
```
[start=3]
1. Save the changed pom.xml
2. Build the application as described here: <<appendix-building.adoc#building, Building Spring Cloud Dataflow>>

=== Datasource

To configure the datasource Add the following properties to the admin.yml or via
environment variables:

a. spring.datasource.url
b. spring.datasource.username
c. spring.datasource.password
d. spring.datasource.driver-class-name

For example adding postgres would look something like this:

* Environment variables:
```
export spring_datasource_url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
export spring_datasource_username=myuser
export spring_datasource_password=mypass
export spring_datasource_driver-class-name="org.postgresql.Driver"
```
* admin.yml
```
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
    username: myuser
    password: mypass
    driver-class-name:org.postgresql.Driver
```
