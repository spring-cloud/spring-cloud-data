== Spring Cloud Data Flow image:https://build.spring.io/plugins/servlet/wittified/build-status/SCD-BMASTER[Build Status, link=https://build.spring.io/browse/SCD-BMASTER] image:https://badge.waffle.io/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow.svg?label=ready&title=Ready[Stories Ready, link=https://waffle.io/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow] image:https://badge.waffle.io/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow.svg?label=In%20Progress&title=In%20Progress[Stories In Progress, link=https://waffle.io/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow]

The Spring Cloud Data Flow project provides orchestration for data microservices, including long-lived
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream[Spring Cloud Stream] applications and
short-lived https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-task[Spring Cloud Task] applications.

== Components

The https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-core[Core]
domain module includes the concept of a *stream* that is a composition of spring-cloud-stream
modules in a linear pipeline from a *source* to a *sink*, optionally including *processor* module(s)
in between. The domain also includes the concept of a *task*, which may be any process that does
not run indefinitely, including https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch[Spring Batch] jobs.

The https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-registry[App Registry]
maintains the set of available apps, and their mappings to URIs.
For example, if relying on Maven coordinates, an app's URI would be of the format:
`maven://<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`

The Data Flow Server is a Spring Boot application that provides a common REST API and UI. For each
runtime environment there is a different version of the Data Flow Server that depends upon a
deployer SPI implementation for that environment. The github locations for these Data Flow Servers are:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local[Local]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry[Cloud Foundry]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn[Apache YARN]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-mesos[Apache Mesos]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-kubernetes[Kubernetes]

_There are also community maintained Spring Cloud Data Flow implementations for Hashicorp's https://github.com/donovanmuller/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-nomad[Nomad] and RedHat's https://github.com/donovanmuller/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-openshift[Openshift]._

The deployer SPI mentioned above is defined within the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer[Spring Cloud Deployer]
project. That provides an abstraction layer for deploying the apps of a given stream or task and managing their lifecycle.
The github locations for the corresponding Spring Cloud Deployer SPI implementations are:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-local[Local]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-cloudfoundry[Cloud Foundry]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-yarn[Apache YARN]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-mesos[Apache Mesos]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-kubernetes[Kubernetes]

The https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell[Shell]
connects to the Data Flow Server's REST API and supports a DSL that simplifies the process of
defining a stream or task and managing its lifecycle.

Instructions for running the Data Flow Server for each runtime environment can be found in their respective github repositories.

=== Building

Clone the repo and type 

----
$ ./mvnw clean install 
----

For more information on building, see this https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/blob/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-docs/src/main/asciidoc/appendix-building.adoc[link].

==== Building on Windows

When using Git on Windows to check out the project, it is important to handle line-endings correctly during checkouts. By default Git will change the line-endings during checkout to `CRLF`. This is, however, not desired for _Spring Cloud Data Flow_ as this may lead to test failures under Windows.

Therefore, please ensure that you set Git property `core.autocrlf` to `false`, e.g. using: `$ git config core.autocrlf false`. Fore more information please refer to the https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration[Git documentation, Formatting and Whitespace].

=== Contributing

We welcome contributions! Follow this https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/blob/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-docs/src/main/asciidoc/appendix-contributing.adoc[link] for more information on how to contribute.

=== Code formatting guidelines

* The directory ./src/eclipse has two files for use with code formatting, `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` for the majority of the code formatting rules and `eclipse.importorder` to order the import statements.

* In eclipse you import these files by navigating `Windows -> Preferences` and then the menu items `Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter` and `Preferences > Java > Code Style > Organize Imports` respectfully.

* In `IntelliJ`, install the plugin `Eclipse Code Formatter`.  You can find it by searching the "Browse Repositories" under the plugin option within `IntelliJ` (Once installed you will need to reboot Intellij for it to take effect).
Then navigate to `Intellij IDEA > Preferences` and select the Eclipse Code Formatter.  Select the `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file for the field `Eclipse Java Formatter config file` and the file `eclipse.importorder` for the field `Import order`.
Enable the `Eclipse code formatter` by clicking `Use the Eclipse code formatter` then click the *OK* button.
** NOTE: If you configure the `Eclipse Code Formatter` from `File > Other Settings > Default Settings` it will set this policy across all of your Intellij projects.
