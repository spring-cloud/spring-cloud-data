The Spring Cloud Data Flow project provides orchestration for data microservices, including long lived
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream[stream] applications and
short lived https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-task[task] applications.

== Components

The https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-core[Core]
domain module includes the concept of a *stream* that is a composition of spring-cloud-stream
modules in a linear pipeline from a *source* to a *sink*, optionally including *processor* module(s)
in between. The domain also includes the concept of a *task*, which may be any process that does
not run indefinitely, including https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch[Spring Batch] jobs.

The https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-registry[App Registry]
maintains the set of available apps, and their mappings to URIs.
For example, if relying on Maven coordinates, an app's URI would be of the format:
`maven://<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`

The Data Flow Server is a Spring Boot application that provides a common REST API and UI. For each
runtime environment there is a different version of the Data Flow Server that depends upon a
deployer SPI implementation for that environment. The github locations for these Data Flow Servers are:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local[Local] (intended for development use only)
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry[Cloud Foundry]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn[Apache YARN]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-mesos[Apache Mesos]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-kubernetes[Kubernetes]

The deployer SPI mentioned above is defined within the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer[Spring Cloud Deployer]
project. That provides an abstraction layer for deploying the apps of a given stream or task and managing their lifecycle.
The github locations for the corresponding Spring Cloud Deployer SPI implementations are:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer/tree/master/spring-cloud-deployer-local[Local]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-cloudfoundry[Cloud Foundry]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-yarn[Apache YARN]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-mesos[Apache Mesos]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-kubernetes[Kubernetes]

The https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell[Shell]
connects to the Data Flow Server's REST API and supports a DSL that simplifies the process of
defining a stream or task and managing its lifecycle.

Instructions for running the Data Flow Server for each runtime environment can be found in their respective github repositories.
